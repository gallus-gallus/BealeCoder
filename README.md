# BealeCoder
## What?
This project is a simple console tool that will be able to code and decode Beale encryption codes (given a key is provided). The idea is that you can create and decode messages using the same encryption style as the original [Beale Ciphers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beale_ciphers).
## How?
### Coding
Currently this project uses only Python 3.0, and I would preferably like to keep it that way. You are more than welcome to contribute to the project, including adding capabilities to handle other forms of encryption (please make ways to code **and** decode if you do add new encryption styles). This is also currently a console tool, but if you want to add a better UI, go ahead. A feature I would really like to add is an easy way to install this on your computer.
### Installing
Currently you have to download the project ad run it in your IDE.
## When
This project is still very new and canâ€™t preform even basic functions. It has no release date as of yet. Want to see this project become a reality? ***Help code it!***
